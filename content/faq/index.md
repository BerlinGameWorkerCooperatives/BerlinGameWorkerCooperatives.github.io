    - q:  "What is a worker cooperative?"
      a: "A worker cooperative is a business owned and operated by its employees. In this model, each worker has an equal stake in the company and an equal say in how it's run. Decisions are made collectively, often through a democratic process, and profits are shared among members."
    - q: "What is a genossenschaft?"
      a: "A Genossenschaft is a legal entity and type of cooperative enterprise common in Germany and German-speaking countries. It's owned and controlled democratically by its members, who each have an equal vote in decision-making."
    - q: "How are decisions made in a game development cooperative?"
      a: "Decisions in a game development cooperative are typically made through a democratic process. Members may vote on important matters such as project direction, hiring decisions, budget allocation, and profit distribution. This democratic structure ensures that interests and perspectives of all workers are heard and considered, leading to more inclusive and collaborative decision-making."
    - q: "Does a democratic company structure bog down the game development process?"
      a: "A democratic business fundamentally has faith in its members. In practice, an environment where people feel empowered, involved, and also directly see the value of their work returned to them also means trusting each other to do what you are great at. A cooperative is not creation by tedious committee, but rather the democratic aspect of a cooperative means that production structures that work well in normal companies can be applied, but with the added benefit of there being a democratic means to resolve issues or change company structure if it is necessary."
    - q: "I want to found a new cooperative studio. How do I get started?"
      a: "Starting a new company is a big step, let alone trying a radically different structure from the norm. Thankfully, you aren't alone. If you want to learn more about the steps required to start a coop, join the [community](https://discord.gg/4XYxuJzSXn) where people who have gone through the process will be able to answer most questions and point you in the right direction. We can also provide support and advice for the practical and procedural questions that come up during the process."
    - q: "Okay, but can you give me a high level overview?"
      a: "In most cases, the process will be largely identical to what is required for a regular business - there will be a business plan, you will need a registration, tax ID, etc. In addition to those things, you will write a document defining the company's laws - the 'bylaws'. This document defines elements like company shares, equity, sick days, meeting procedure, conflict resolution, hiring practises, etc. Before the cooperative can operate, all members will need to validate this document democratically. The bylaws are a living document - it can be amended over time or expanded as the company grows and changes."
    - q: "What about founding a cooperative in a country that isn't Germany?"
      a: "Although the legal process and associated entities may differ, we are all united in our values. All cooperatives face similar questions during their founding that will need to be put on paper and validated by the members - we can provide a pool of experience and feedback for those questions, and some emotional support from folks who care can keep the wind in your sails."
