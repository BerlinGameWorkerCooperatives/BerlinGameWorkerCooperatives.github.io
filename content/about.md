Berlin Game Worker Cooperatives is a community of game devs working in cooperatives, aiming to start new cooperatives or just interested in the subject. 

Berlin Game Worker Cooperatives was founded in spring 2023 by members of Randwerk, Deep Sky Games and Purple Sloth Studios, three Berlin based studio cooperatives, but welcomes studios and individuals from all around the world.

Berlin Game Worker Cooperatives aims to bring people together to exchange knowledge and empower each other to fight for more democratic work places, more worker controlled studios and overall better labour practices in the industry.
