Berlin Game Worker Cooperatives is a community of studios and developers that operate cooperatives, are aming to start a cooperative, or are interested in progessive labor practises in our industry.

Berlin Game Worker Cooperatives was founded in spring 2023 by members of Randwerk, Deep Sky Games and Purple Sloth Studios, three Berlin based studios, and has been active in connecting and evangelising on the topic. We gladly welcome studios and individuals from all around the world to step into our community.

Berlin Game Worker Cooperatives aims to bring people together to exchange knowledge and empower each other to fight for more democratic work places, more worker controlled studios and overall better labour practices in the industry. We are committed to a more human and equitable way of making games.
